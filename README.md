fetchWeather
============

Hello. fetchWeather is my first experiment with parsing JSON. I have used Google Weather's API to gain information regarding
temperature, Pressure and Humidity of a location. After the user enters the name of the locations, the App searches the Google
Weather API for the place and then I parse the JSON information to the App to be displayed to the user.

In the coming days, I Plan to work on the UI and add more information to the App.
